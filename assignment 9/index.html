<h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<br>
  AND CLOUD COMPUTING</h2>
  <p class="main">Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not- <br>for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and <br>
    Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech <br>
    fields like</p>
     
    <ul>
      <li class="ba"> <a href="#computing">Cloud Native Computing</a></li>
      <li> <a href="#artificial">Artificial Intelligence</a></li>
      <li><a href="#block">Block Chain</a></li>
      <li><a href="#thing">Internet Of Things</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="c">C</span>loud Native computing:</h3>
    <p id="computing"><strong>The Cloud Native Computing </strong>program prepares the students to program in open source <br>
      technologies like,<strong><i> Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</i> </strong><br>
      while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development <br>
      techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>
      <h3><span class="c">A</span>rtificial Intelligence:</h3>
      <p id="artificial">The <strong> artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI <br>
        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <strong><i> Python, Numpy, Pandas, <br>
        Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</i></strong> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and <br>
        ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>
        <h3><span class="c">B</span>lock Chain:</h3>
        <p id="block">The main emphasis of <strong> Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like <strong><i>Ethereum <br>
          and Hyperledger (Fabric)</i></strong>, and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on <br>
          frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps <br>
          (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a- <br>service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>
    
   <h3><span class="c">I</span>nternet Of Things:</h3>
   <p id="thing">The <strong>Internet of things </strong>program introduces the students to open source development <br>
    technologies like <strong><i> Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, <br>
    and Kubernetes</i></strong> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT <br>
    Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
